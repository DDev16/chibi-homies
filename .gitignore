   Mint Chibi:

Users start by minting their Chibi NFTs, which are cute and unique characters in your collection. This is the first step in their NFT journey.
Soft Stake for Gems:

After minting a Chibi, users have the option to soft stake it. Soft staking involves locking their Chibi in a smart contract, and in return, they earn gems over time. The longer they stake, the more gems they accumulate. This incentivizes holding onto their Chibis.
Pay for Gems to Level Up:

Users can also purchase gems directly if they don't want to wait for the soft staking rewards. Gems can be used for various purposes, including leveling up their Chibi.
Evolve into Zombie:

With a sufficient number of gems, users can choose to level up their Chibi to the next stage, which is transforming it into a Zombie. This evolution makes their NFT even more unique and valuable, unlocking new features and abilities for their Zombie character.
Additional Features:

To make the collection more engaging, consider adding features like battles, quests, or special abilities for the evolved Zombies. Users can participate in events, challenges, or games that utilize their Chibi and Zombie NFTs.
Community Engagement:

Foster a community around your NFT collection through social media, Discord, or other platforms. Encourage users to share their Chibi and Zombie experiences, trade NFTs within the community, and collaborate on in-game activities.
Utility for Gems:

Aside from leveling up, give gems utility within your ecosystem. Users could use them for customization, enhancing the attributes of their NFTs, or participating in exclusive events and auctions.
Scarcity and Rarity:

Introduce varying levels of rarity for both Chibis and Zombies to create a sense of scarcity and exclusivity. Rare NFTs could have special abilities or perks, making them highly sought after.
Governance and Decision-Making:

Consider involving the community in decision-making processes related to the collection's development and future direction. This can create a sense of ownership and engagement among your NFT holders.
Evolving Storyline:

Keep the storyline of your NFT collection dynamic and evolving. Introduce new characters, events, and challenges over time to keep users engaged and excited about the future of their NFTs.
By enhancing your NFT collection with these elements, you can create a more immersive and rewarding experience for your users, increasing the value and appeal of your NFTs
